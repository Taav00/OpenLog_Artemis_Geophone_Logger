## What do I need?

### Essentials:

- **[OpenLog Artemis - SPX-15846](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15846)**
- **[Qwiic PT100 ADS122C04 - SPX-16770](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16770)**
- **[SM-24 Geophone - SEN-11744](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11744)**
- **1300Ω Resistor**
  - 1300Ω will give best performance but a [1000Ω (1KΩ) resistor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14492) will work too
  - You could connect a 1000Ω (1KΩ) and a 330Ω in series. You will find both in our [Resistor Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969)
- **Stranded Hook-Up Wire**
  - The 22 AWG wire in our [Hook-Up Wire Assortment](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11375) is a perfect choice
- **Qwiic Cable**
  - A [50mm Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14426) is all you need but our [Qwiic Cable Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15081) gives you all the options
